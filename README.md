# awesome-continual-learning / awesome-lifelong-learning
The objective of continual learning is to have machines replicate human-like learning of being able to sequentially learn new tasks and observations while still being able to retain the knowledge obtained from past experiences.

The following is a list of papers, blogs, datasets and software in the field of lifelong / continual / sequential / incremental machine learning.
